# E-Commerce Data Engineering Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a modern AWS-based data lake architecture for processing e-commerce transactional data. The pipeline ingests raw JSON datasets from Amazon S3, transforms and enriches the data through multiple processing layers, and produces analytics-ready datasets for reporting and business intelligence.

The solution follows the Medallion Architecture (Landing → Bronze → Silver → Gold) pattern commonly used in enterprise data platforms.

---

## Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to transform raw operational e-commerce data into curated analytical datasets that support:

* Sales performance reporting
* Product analytics
* Customer analytics
* Executive dashboards
* Ad-hoc analytical queries

The pipeline enables stakeholders to analyze customer purchasing behavior, product performance, revenue trends, and operational metrics through a structured and scalable data platform.

# Solution Architecture

## Data Flow

Landing Layer → Bronze Layer → Silver Layer → Gold Layer → Athena → Dashboard

### Landing Layer

Raw JSON data is ingested into Amazon S3 without modifications.

Data Sources:

* Carts
* Products
* Users

Purpose:

* Preserve source system data
* Enable reprocessing when required
* Maintain a historical raw data archive

---

### Bronze Layer

The Bronze layer performs initial cleansing and schema standardization.

Transformations:

* Data type standardization
* Column selection
* Sensitive data masking using SHA-256 hashing
* Nested JSON flattening
* Entity separation

Generated Tables:

| Table                 | Description                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| bronze_cart_header    | Cart transaction headers    |
| bronze_cart_items     | Cart line items             |
| bronze_products       | Product master data         |
| bronze_reviews        | Product reviews             |
| bronze_users          | User profile information    |
| bronze_user_companies | User company information    |
| bronze_user_locations | User geographic information |

Storage Format:

* Apache Parquet
* Snappy Compression

---

### Silver Layer

The Silver layer integrates related business entities and applies business-level transformations.

Transformations:

* Entity consolidation
* Review aggregation
* Relationship modeling
* Business-ready datasets

Generated Tables:

#### silver_user_profiles

Combines:

* User information
* Company information
* Location information

#### silver_products

Combines:

* Product information
* Aggregated review metrics

Additional Metrics:

* Average Product Rating
* Review Count

#### silver_orders

Combines:

* Cart headers
* Cart items
* Product attributes

Additional Business Attributes:

* Category
* Brand

---

### Gold Layer

The Gold layer implements a dimensional model optimized for analytics workloads.

Data Model:

#### Fact Table

##### fact_sales

Measures:

* Sales Amount
* Quantity Sold
* Discount Amount
* Total Products
* Total Quantity

Foreign Keys:

* User Key
* Product Key

---

#### Dimension Tables

##### dim_users

Contains:

* User demographics
* Location information
* Company information

##### dim_products

Contains:

* Product details
* Category
* Brand
* Product ratings

# Data Pipeline Execution Flow

## Step 1: Landing to Bronze

AWS Glue Job:

```text
landing_to_bronze.py
```

Responsibilities:

* Read raw JSON data
* Flatten nested structures
* Apply schema enforcement
* Mask sensitive information
* Write curated parquet files

Output:

```text
s3://ecommerce-bronze90/
```

---

## Step 2: Bronze to Silver

AWS Glue Job:

```text
bronze_to_silver.py
```

Responsibilities:

* Join related datasets
* Aggregate review metrics
* Build business entities

Output:

```text
s3://ecommerce-silver90/
```

---

## Step 3: Silver to Gold

AWS Glue Job:

```text
silver_to_gold.py
```

Responsibilities:

* Build star schema
* Create fact table
* Create dimension tables

Output:

```text
s3://ecommerce-gold90/
```

# Data Security

The pipeline applies hashing to personally identifiable information (PII) before storage.

Protected Attributes:

* Email Address
* Phone Number
* IP Address
* MAC Address
* SSN
* EIN
* Cryptocurrency Wallet Information

Hashing Algorithm:

```text
SHA-256
```

---
